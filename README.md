# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

I built this project as the first iteration of my professional developer portfolio. It includes About Me, Work, and Contact Me sections. The portfolio houses my current deployed web applications and I plan to add to it as I continue to make projects. I learned flexbox layouts to make my portfolio responsive across desktop and mobile devices. I also learned about media queries and css variables and used them to improve the style of my portfolio.

## Usage

Access my portfolio at [https://gfuselier.github.io/Professional-Portfolio](https://gfuselier.github.io/Professional-Portfolio)
